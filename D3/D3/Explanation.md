# Where is the concept of delegation in this program?
The concept of delegation is applied within the pruefer methods in the Validator class. In our program, delegation 
refers to the clear distinction between user input handling and the program's logic. Instead of performing validations 
directly within the user interaction logic, the responsibility is delegated to the Validator class, which handles 
the core validation logic.
