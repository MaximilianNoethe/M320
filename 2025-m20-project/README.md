# Description
In this project, we developed the backend application for a restaurant called REST-Foods. The application offers a variety of menus and dishes, as well as a convenient reservation creation function. All of this can be easily managed using Basic HTTP Requests. Thanks to robust CRUD operations, users can seamlessly Create, Read, Update, and Delete menus, dishes, and reservations, ensuring efficient management.

The data for our backend is securely stored and managed within our own custom-designed database (Docker), providing a reliable foundation for the applicationâ€™s functionality.
